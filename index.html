      <p id="fantastic">"Real fighting game players use arcade sticks!" is an outdated legacy myth.<br><br>
         Most people saying that grew up playing in arcades, on arcade cabinets, which is what modern sticks you plug in
         to your console are
         modeled after.<br><br>
         Furthermore, arcade sticks were a way to cope with bad controllers in days gone by like the Xbox 360
         controller. What a nightmare that pad was.<br><br>
         Sticks are, admittedly, a very nice novelty item, they are very customizable, and there are a large variety of
         styles and brands.<br><br>
         However, you most certainly don't need one to do good or win.<br><br>
         At the end of the day, use what you enjoy using and what makes you feel comfortable.<br><br>
         Technology has come a long way in making every controller choice a good one.

         <div class="exec-col">
            <p id="starter">
               I heavily recommend all new players sticking to one character<br><br>
               and getting familiar with all their basic and special attacks.<br><br>
               If you keep changing characters while learning, it would be as if<br><br>
               you were exchanging your legs every couple of days while learning to walk.<br><br>
               That is to say, you should fully learn to ride a bicycle,<br><br>
               before moving on to the motorcycle.<br><br>
               ...<br><br>
               I further recommend most people try and start off with the main character<br><br>
               or protagonist to learn how the game fundamentally works.<br><br>
               However, I also have come to learn while teaching over the years that<br><br>
               the key for some people is playing the character you like most,<br><br>
               even at the beginning. If you enjoy what you're doing,<br><br>
               you'll want to come back and do it again, because you're having fun,<br><br>
               not doing chores. Your mileage WILL vary, find what works for you!<br>

               This the most commonly agreed-upon notation people use to talk about 2D fighting game inputs.<br><br>
               Let's use Ryu's list of commands above for reference, using numpad notation to talk about his
               moves.<br><br>
               I am going to assume you are in the first player position - on the left, facing right - and holding your
               thumb or stick at neutral (5).<br><br>
               For Ryu's hadoken (fireball), you would move your controller or stick in a quarter circle forward, or
               2-3-6+Punch.<br><br>
               To do his shoryuken (dragon punch), you'll want to move your controller/stick first to 6, down to 2, and
               then
               slightly
               forward to 3, or 6-2-3+Punch.<br><br>
               For tatsumaki senpukyaku (hurricane kick) you'll want to do the opposite of a hadoken, quarter
               circle
               back, or 2-1-4+Kick.<br><br>
               More complex inputs can come later, it's good to get those three down first. Make sure you practice on
               both sides of the screen.

   <section class="HITBOXES">
      <h1 id="FIFTH">Hitboxes</h1>
      <p id="hitPtOne">
         Much like learning about the code that's going on behind the scenes to make websites run,<br>
         there's quite a bit going on under the hood when you start to break down fighting games to understand what's
         happening.<br>
         What the player and audience see on the screen are a couple of characters fighting and doing cool moves.<br>
         It may LOOK like your character is punching above or in front of them, but in reality they're manipulating a
         box or boxes attached to their body.<br>
         Let's examine one of Ryu's hitboxes below:
      </p>
      <div class="hitRowOne">
         <figure>
            <img src="./images/RyuHKgif.gif" alt="ryuHK.gif">
         </figure>
         <ul id="hboxList">
            <li> The <span id="whiteWord"> white hitbox</span> represents Ryu's own hitbox, where you can hurt the
               character.<br>
               Notice that while Ryu is doing his kick attack, there is still a white hitbox on his leg that can be
               hurt.<br>
               This means he can still be hit while he is attacking, the hurtbox on his leg is just moving with the attack.
            </li><br><br><br><br>
            <li>The <span id="redWord">red hitbox</span> represents what is actually happening when Ryu tries to kick
               his opponent.<br>
               If the red hitbox of your attacking move overlaps your opponent's white hitbox, it will make
               "contact".<br>
               This interaction is at the core of what fighting games are: an exchange of hitboxes and hurtboxes.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="hitProj">
         <p2>
            There are many different kinds of <a
               href="https://www.eventhubs.com/images/2011/sep/30/ryus-hit-box-information-super-street-fighter-4-arcade-edition-image-1/">hitboxes:</a>
            strike, high, overhead, low, and grab.<br>
            The scope of these go beyond this guide, but let's examine one other kind of hitbox: <p2 style="color: red">
               the projectile.</p2>
         </p2>
      </div>
      <img id="hitHado" src="./images/RyuHadoGIF.gif" alt="hadoken.gif">
      <div id="hitProjTwo">
         <p>
            Rather than being part of a character's body, a projectile is, you guessed it, shot or fired by a
            character.<br>
            Although you can see it takes a moment to start up and get going, what's unique is that it will keep
            traveling with no hurtbox.<br>
            This means that you can act independently of your projectile after you've finished firing it. It gives you
            an advantage in controlling space.<br>
            One last thing to consider is that projectiles can clash with eachother.<br>
            This may result in what you may have heard in the past as "fireball wars," or a struggle between two players
            to control space.<br>
         </p>
      </div>
   </section>
   <section class="FRAME_DATA">
      <h1 id="SIXTH">Frame Data</h1>
      <div>
         <p>
            If hitboxes are the engines behind what makes fighting games run, then frame data is like the battery and
            alternator.<br>
            It's another very important aspect behind what's happening under the hood of your fighting game.<br><br>
            
               Most, if not all modern fighting games "run" or "process" at 60 frames per second.<br>
               Therefore, one frame is equal to 1/60 of a second.<br><br>
               If Ryu's jab 'came out' in 3 frames,<br>
               that means it only takes 3/60 of a second to be active.<br><br>

            Let's take a moment to think about this:<br>
         </p>
         <span style="color:greenyellow; font-size: 40px">Do you think a big windup knockout punch has the same effect as a jab
            or leg kick?<br></span>

               (Faster attacks have less startup.)

            <li>
               <b><u><span style="color:firebrick;">Active frames:</span></u></b> your punch, kick, or other attack is out,<br>

         </ol>

            <u><p style="font-size: 40px; color:burlywood;">Understanding this, even just fundamentally, is essential to understanding risk

            <span style="font-size: 35px; text-align: center;">
            Let's examine the risk vs. reward a little more closely:</span><br><br>
            Every attack has its own frame data, and certain attacks are safer than others.<br>
            Yes, massive wind-up punches or kicks look cool and are satisfying to land,<br>
            but they are not a safe option to rely on.<br>
            This is why the jab is like the swiss army knife of real fighting.<br><br>

            If an attack is "plus on hit," (most attacks are) that means you can start moving or attacking<br>
            after your recovery frames are over, while your opponent is stuck<br>
            in X amount of frames of being hit (see right).<br><br>

            If an attack is "plus on block," you can start moving or attacking<br>
            after your recovery is over, but your opponent is still stuck in X amount of frames of block.<br><br>

            Likewise, however, if an attack of yours is negative on block, that means the opponent will recover<br>
            from the blockstun you inflict before you finish recovering from whatever attack you did.<br>
            This essentially means you "lose your turn" because they can act before you can.<br><br>

            If an attack is very negative on block (they can act long before you recover),<br>
            you could find yourself getting punished, because they recovered from blocking your high risk attack!<br>
            This means you can't block before they can retaliate, since you're still stuck in a bunch of recovery frames.<br>
            If you're going to commit to a high-risk, high-reward attack, make sure it's going to connect and hit!

            <br><span style="font-size: 30px;">Bonus: if you cancel the active frames of a normal attack with a special attack like hadoken (fireball), 
               <br>before the enemy's hitstun (see above pic) ends, what do you think will happen?</span><br>

   <section class="CONCLUSION">
      <!---todo: consider adding observation (watching replays) to conclusion(hearing own voice), and section about other FGs, supplemental resources (footsies video, glossary, etc?)-->
      <h1 id="SEVENTH">Wrapping things up</h1>
      <div class="sf3bg">
         <p id="concP1">
            The first and final obstacle to winning and improving is going to be yourself and your own mind.<br>
            As with any other meaningful venture or undertaking, you will find yourself standing in your own way.<br>
            The best way to overcome this is by watching recordings of the matches you play or compete in.<br><br>
            Have you ever felt uncomfortable after hearing your own voice from recorded dialogue or an answering machine?<br>
            Regardless of your prior confidence, a realization and sudden burst of self-awareness like this is a wake up call.<br><br>
            You may <em>think</em> you were playing your best in that one match, but will likely think otherwise when you watch it later.<br>
            It is good to do this regularly, much like checking in to see your weight for gains or losses, it is honest feedback.<br><br><br>
         </p>
         <div id="concP2">
         <p2>
               Enter: replays. You gotta go back and "watch the footage," as they say.<br>
               For example, while you're reviewing a saved replay <br>
               from one of your matches, you might remember saying:<br>
                "I swear I did a dragon punch in round 2 that one time he jumped at me!"<br>
               only to watch it back and say "...oh wait no i made an input error after all..."<br>
               In many modern fighting games, you can toggle controller inputs during replays.<br>
               Doing so, you may realize: "wow this guy's inputs I was fighting are super clean!"<br> 
               or perhaps, "dang this guy was mashing buttons like crazy the whole time..."<br><br>
               A big thing to keep an eye out for is repeat mistakes or patterns.<br>
               Maybe you're not pressing the advantage hard enough when you are in an advantage state,<br>
               or maybe you keep getting stuffed when you try to force your turn back in disadvantage.<br>
               
               <br>Lastly, it's important to watch other player's replays, not just your own.<br>
               There is nothing wrong with copying things from players better than you.<br>
               I recommend watching higher level matches, both online and tournament.<br>
               It's a good starting point, and honestly, downright entertaining the more you learn.

            <br>At the end of the day, fighting games are a journey<br>
            with highs and lows, sorrow and joy, anger and salt.<br>
            You have the opportunity to travel and meet other warriors<br>
            who are also on the path to grow and improve or seek glory.<br>
            David Sirlin, author of <a href="https://www.sirlin.net/ptw">Playing To Win</a>, sums it up well:<br><br>
            <div class="sirlinQuote">
               <p id="quoteText">
               &quot;So do all the lessons of winning at games apply to real life? No, they do not. <br>
               But only a fool would walk away from competitive games<br>
               without learning a wealth of life lessons.<br>
               Games require training, practice, and discipline.<br>
               Having a love for what you’re doing really does help you.<br>
               Games teach you to remain calm under the most dire of circumstances,<br>
               and to never give up until your very last breath of life is spent.<br>
               They teach you to learn from your mistakes, rather than shift the blame to others,<br>
               because that is the only real way to improve.<br>
               They teach that continuous self-improvement over time is the only way to survive.&quot;
